## PaperSoccer

Authors:

* [Nikita Breslavsky](https://github.com/NickBres)
* [Chen Dahan](https://github.com/ChenDahan13)


Built With:
* Language: Python 3.11
* Scapy 2.5.0 (DNS,DHCP)
* PyGame 2.1.2 (Client - GUI)

We made the game named Paper Soccer. You can find only the game without server functions with explanations in the separate [repository](https://github.com/NickBres/PaperSoccer).
Apllication server in our case is Game Server manages all the game data and its rules. Client (two players) can connect to the server to connect between them and play. All the communications between client and server are made with TCP but game data transfer made with RUDP.
